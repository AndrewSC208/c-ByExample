C++ is "free form" meaning the compiler does not care
about white space.  It is for the benefit of the reader.  The
conventions are:

- Each statement ending with a ; is on a line by itself.
- Braces { and } are on lines by themselves.
- Code inside the braces is indented by 2-4 spaces (be consistent).
- Braces line up vertically with each other and the code outside it.

// Comment on commments:

// Comments are ignored by the compiler.  Their purpose is to
// explain the code to the reader.

// This is a single line comment.  It goes to the end of the line.

   This is a multiline comment.
   It continues to the closing comment character:

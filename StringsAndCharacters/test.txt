/* Notes:

- getline(cin, s) reads a line of input up to a newline and discards
  the newline.  Unlike >> it reads spaces, tabs, and blank lines
  (returned as "").  It does not save the trailing newline in s.
  It returns true if a line was read, false at EOF.

// This program reads a line at a time and prints it.
// To test, redirect input from a file, e.g. string3 < file.txt
// You can copy a text file like this: string3 < input > output
